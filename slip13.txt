Q.1) Execute the following HDFS commands on Hadoop environment. [10]
a) Create a college.txt file in root directory and move this file in Hadoop environment.
b) Count the number of files and directories in HDFS.(use specified format as option
-v,-h,-q)
c) du command
d) implement find command for college.txt
e) Remove a bank_details directory from Hadoop environment. (Create a bank_details
directory).
(Note: you may create a file/directory depending on the command requirements.)

1) Create a college.txt file in root directory and move this file in Hadoop environment.

hadoop fs -copyFromLocal "C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\college.txt" data1\         (hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /opt/hadoop/BDA/a2.txt /data1)

hadoop fs -ls data1\

2) Count the number of files and directories in HDFS.(use specified format as option
-v,-h,-q)

hadoop fs -count [-v] [-h] [-q] data1\college.txt						(hadoop fs -count /)
count: `[-v]': No such file or directory
count: `[-h]': No such file or directory
count: `[-q]': No such file or directory
           0            1                 22 data1/college.txt



3) du command

hadoop fs -du data1\college.txt							(hadoop fs -du /data1/college.txt)
22  22  data1/college.txt

4) implement find command for college.txt  					(hadoop fs -find /data1)

hadoop fs -find data1\college.txt
data1/college.txt


5) Remove a bank_details directory from Hadoop environment. (Create a bank_details
directory).

hadoop fs -mkdir bank_details									(hadoop fs -mkdir /bank_details)

C:\hadoop-3.3.4\sbin>hadoop fs -rmr bank_details
rmr: DEPRECATED: Please use '-rm -r' instead.
